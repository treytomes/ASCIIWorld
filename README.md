ASCIIWorld
==========

ASCII character-based 2D adventure game.

Inspired by ZZT, Megazeux, Minecraft, and Dwarf Fortress (in that order).

http://oem437.wordpress.com/ will contain updates to the development story as I see fit.

I haven't updated the blog, or project, in a while.  Sorry in advance if it doesn't work right...
