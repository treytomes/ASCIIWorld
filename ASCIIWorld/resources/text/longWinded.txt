This is a sample dialog message.  I am seeking to make this dialog message as absolutely long as I can imagine, in order that I might test my ability to make this sample dialog message word wrap around the width and height of it's parent label, which should be resized to fit the size of it's parent ContentControl.  I suppose that we will soon see if what I have done has accomplished the task for which I have set out to accomplish.
